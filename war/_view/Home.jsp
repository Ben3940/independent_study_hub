            Independent study is a semester long, student lead project to expand the knowledge of the <br />
            scientific community.  Students will select an advisor to work under and expand an area of<br />
            science.  Students will order their chemicals and design their own methodology (with the  <br />
            assistance of their advisor). <br />

            poster and your final study report are required at a minimum.  Additional pictures of lab <br />
            work or documentation is also welcomed. <br />
